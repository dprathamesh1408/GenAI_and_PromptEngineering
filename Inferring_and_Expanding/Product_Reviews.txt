Product: Laptop
Review: Too good works better than whats it worth, also, it has 1 empty RAM slot, max ram is 64gb expandable, 1 slot has 8gb other one is empty, battery life is also decent, dont expect 10 hours backup on gaming, one empty slot of 2.5inch SATA SSD or HDD as well. Boots up fast, works really fast H series processors are at par with Desktop processors in performance and handling.- salil panwar

Product: Washing Machine
Review: Excellent product.Panasonic always has been my favourite. Extremely happy with wash quality and simple features. Full one time load is washed in 42 minutes. What else do you expect. 14800 rs is just an awesome deal for a 7kg fully autamatic machine. Highly recommended
